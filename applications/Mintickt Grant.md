## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

_Mintickt is a NFT ticketing platform that allows anyone to create events and sell their tickets as unique NFTs. The unique features of Mintickt are on the one hand the marketplace for creators, who offer their own ticket designs and hence get a share of the sales through royalties. But also the social aspects, which will be integrated into the event pages like the liking feature and commenting on events. With this we want to promote interaction and connect people who go to the same event._

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- **If_ the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary):** Mintickt Wallet (iOS & Android)
- **A brief description of your project.** Mintickt v2.0 is the evolution of our v1.0 dApp, which we launched recently, which allows everyone to create events and offer their tickets as an NFT.
- **An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem:** Our marketplace is built on top of Mintbase NFT toolkit in order to build our own minter, market, and NFT redeeming system. Last month NEAR foundation has awarded us a grant to build the first version of our platform.
- **An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.:** Guille: I am an artist myself and know the event industry very well. I also love collecting physical tickets like festival or event tickets, but unfortunately they don't last forever and you can't just take them everywhere or show them to friends. That's why I wanted to make events memorable on the blockchain.

Kemal: I've been in the event industry since 2017 and have also hosted events. I know the problems that physical or digital tickets bring, as they can be easily copied, so there is always a black market. Which is often to the detriment of the end consumer. With NFT tickets, ticket sales can not only be made more transparent, but also safer for the end consumer.  

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- **Mockups/designs of any UI components:** https://www.figma.com/file/aTY6ml8eHQQHWUwjYdBNng/Mintickt-Wallet 
- **Data models / API specifications of the core functionality:** 
- **An overview of the technology stack to be used:** Our dev team will use React Native to develop the app for iOS an Android.
- **Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed:** <br>
    - NEAR Developer tools: https://near.org/developer-tools/<br>
    - MintbaseJS: https://github.com/Mintbase/mintbase-js/blob/main/src/wallet.ts<br>
    - Mintnbase Graph: https://docs.mintbase.io/dev/data-and-indexer/retrieving-data/mintbase-graph<br>
    - Decentral bank: https://github.com/DecentralBankDAO<br>
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic: www.mintickt.com
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement: We will not provide any physical tickets.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- **Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?:** We are developing an NFT ticketing platform that will allow anyone to create their own event page and sell their tickets as NFTs on the NEAR Blockchain.

- **Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?:** Mintickt is aimed at both B2C and B2B users who create events. However, since we also want to build a creator community that creates unique ticket designs, we also want to target NFT artists who can offer their ticket design on Mintickt as a template.

- **What need(s) does your project meet?:** It is primarily about creating tickets, so we are targeting the ticketing industry. This can be in the event, sports but also entertainment sector.

- **Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?:** On NEAR there is Seatlab and Backstage

  - **If so, how is your project different?:** Seatlab, for example, takes a completely different approach than we do. Seatlab is more technical and analytical, while Mintickt is the more creative ticketing platform. On Mintickt you can choose ticket design templates from real NFT artists in the future, Seatlab doesn't take this approach.
    
  - **If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems:?** The same is true for Backstage.

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/mintbase/Grants-Program/tree/master/rfp-proposal) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.

## Future Plans

Please include here

- how you intend to use, enhance, promote and support your project in the short term, and
Our goal is to become a ticketing platform for B2C and B2B and to work with creators to offer the most unique ticket designs from artists around the world on our platform. 

Our short term goal is to start with some small events or festivals to test our product with a smaller user base.

- the team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it.
In the long term, we would like to launch various marketing campaigns on different social media channels to attract more users to our platform. Our biggest goal is to bring Web2 users to Web3, so we want to make it as easy as possible to get started.
